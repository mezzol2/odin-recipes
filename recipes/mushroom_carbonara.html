        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Pasta, preferably fresh</li>
            <li>Bacon, preferably pre-diced</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cooking Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
            <li>Shredded Parmesan</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Dice the garlic and bacon (if needed), and chop up the mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Heat a saucepan with a litle cooking oil to medium-high heat.
                Once hot, add and cook the bacon until it begins to turn brown.</li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms to the saucepan.  Cook the mushrooms until they begin
                to turn brown.  If using dry pasta, bring a pot of salted water to boil,
                and set the pasta in when boiling.  Cook the pasta until al dente.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic to the saucepan and roast for about 30 seconds.  Also add
                salt, pepper, and Italian Spices now.</li>
            <li>Add your heavy cream and butter to the saucepan now. Stir well.</li>
            <li>If using fresh pasta, bring a pot of salted water to boil, and add pasta
                while boiling. <strong>NOTE:</strong> fresh pasta only needs about 90
                seconds to fully cook.</li>
            <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it simmer for a few minutes to thicken.
            </li>
            <li>Once the pasta is done and the sauce has thickened a bit, add the pasta and
                some pasta water to the saucepan.  If you add too much water, let the sauce
                simmer a bit to re-thicken the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Serve in a deep bowl.  Spread shredded cheese and freshly ground pepper to
                individual bowls for taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
